Dynamic reward rate calculation during active periods\n *\n * Reward Calculation:\n * - Rewards per second = rewardRate\n * - Each user receives: (userShares / MAX_STAKING_SUPPLY) * rewardRate tokens/sec\n * - address(0) receives: (unstakedShares / MAX_STAKING_SUPPLY) * rewardRate tokens/sec\n *\n * Example:\n * - Total shares: 2353\n * - User A stakes: 1000 shares → address(0): 1353 shares\n * - Reward rate: 100 tokens/sec\n * - User A earns: (1000/2353) * 100 = 42.5 tokens/sec\n * - address(0) earns: (1353/2353) * 100 = 57.5 tokens/sec\n */\ncontract Staking is Ownable, IStaking {\n    // ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓\n    // ┃       Constants           ┃\n    // ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛\n\n    /// @notice Maximum total shares in the system (fixed: 2353e18)\n    /// @dev This is immutable and represents the total share pool\n    /// Staked shares + unstaked shares (at address(0)) always equals this value\n    uint256 public constant MAX_STAKING_SUPPLY = 2353 * 1e18;\n\n    // ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓\n    // ┃       Immutable State     ┃\n    // ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛\n\n    /// @notice Reward token contract interface (supports burn)\n    IERC20Burnable public immutable rewardToken;\n\n    /// @notice Staking token contract interface\n    IERC20 public immutable stakingToken;\n\n    // ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓\n    // ┃      Mutable State         ┃\n    // ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛\n\n    /// @notice Total amount of shares currently staked by users\n    /// @dev address(0) holds: MAX_STAKING_SUPPLY - totalStakingSupply shares\n    /// @dev Invariant: totalStakingSupply + _stakingBalances[address(0)] == MAX_STAKING_SUPPLY\n    uint256 public totalStakingSupply;\n\n    /// @notice Mapping of user address to their staked shares\n    /// @dev address(0) is special: represents unstaked shares\n    /// @dev Invariant: sum of all _stakingBalances == MAX_STAKING_SUPPLY\n    mapping(address account => uint256 balance) private _stakingBalances;\n\n    /// @notice Duration of each reward period in seconds\n    /// @dev Must be set by owner before rewards can be distributed\n    uint256 public duration;\n\n    /// @notice Timestamp when the current reward period ends\n    /// @dev If block.timestamp >= finishAt, rewards are no longer accruing\n    uint256 public finishAt;\n\n    /// @notice Timestamp of last reward update\n    /// @dev Used to calculate time elapsed for reward accrual\n    uint256 public updatedAt;\n\n    /// @notice Reward tokens to distribute per second\n    /// @dev Calculated as: total_reward_amount / duration\n    uint256 public rewardRate;\n\n    /// @notice Accumulated reward per share, multiplied by 1e18 for precision\n    /// @dev Updated every time rewards are recalculated\n    /// @dev Used to prevent rounding errors in reward distribution\n    uint256 public rewardPerTokenStored;\n\n    /// @notice User's last recorded rewardPerTokenStored value\n    /// @dev Used to calculate only new rewards earned since last update\n    /// @dev Invariant: only updated when user's balance or rewards change\n    mapping(address => uint256) public userRewardPerTokenPaid;\n\n    /// @notice Pending rewards for a user, not yet claimed\n    /// @dev Updated by updateReward modifier\n    /// @dev Includes both stored pending rewards and newly accrued rewards\n    mapping(address => uint256) public rewards;\n\n    // ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓\n    // ┃         Modifiers         ┃\n    // ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛\n\n    /**\n     * @notice Updates reward state for an account\n     * @dev\n     * Execution order (Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern):\n     * 1.

This can be worked around by making\n those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry\n points to them.\n TIP: If EIP-1153 (transient storage) is available on the chain you're deploying at,\n consider using {ReentrancyGuardTransient} instead.\n TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways\n to protect against it, check out our blog post\n https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/[Reentrancy After Istanbul]."

Reward distribution is pro-rata across all 2353 shares, regardless of staking amount\n 2. Unstaked shares earn rewards through address(0)\n 3. Owner can burn address(0) rewards to reduce inflation\n 4. Dynamic reward rate calculation during active periods\n Reward Calculation:\n - Rewards per second = rewardRate\n - Each user receives: (userShares / MAX_STAKING_SUPPLY) * rewardRate tokens/sec\n - address(0) receives: (unstakedShares / MAX_STAKING_SUPPLY) * rewardRate tokens/sec\n Example:\n - Total shares: 2353\n - User A stakes: 1000 shares → address(0): 1353 shares\n - Reward rate: 100 tokens/sec\n - User A earns: (1000/2353) * 100 = 42.5 tokens/sec\n - address(0) earns: (1353/2353) * 100 = 57.5 tokens/sec"

Can be called multiple times to top-up rewards.\n Workflow:\n 1. Validate amount > 0\n 2. Calculate and update rewards for address(0) (unstaked shares)\n 3. Check duration is set\n 4. Calculate new reward rate:\n    - If no active period: rewardRate = amount / duration\n    - If active period: rewardRate = (amount + remainingRewards) / duration\n 5. Validate rewardRate > 0\n 6. Validate contract has sufficient reward tokens\n 7. Set finishAt = current time + duration\n 8. Emit StakingRewardsUpdated event\n @param amount Total reward tokens to distribute over the duration\n               Example: 1000e18 tokens over 30 days\n Requirements:\n - Only owner can call\n - amount > 0\n - duration must be > 0 (must call updateDuration first)\n - Contract must have: amount + (remainingRewards if active) tokens\n - Resulting rewardRate must be > 0 (amount must not be too small)\n Effects:\n - rewardRate = new calculated rate\n - finishAt = block.timestamp + duration\n - updatedAt = block.timestamp\n - rewards[address(0)] is updated (unstaked rewards included)\n Emits: StakingRewardsUpdated event with new reward rate\n Example:\n - duration = 30 days (2,592,000 seconds)\n - amount = 2,592,000e18 tokens\n - rewardRate = 1e18 tokens/second\n - Each user with 1 share gets: (1/2353) * 1e18 = ~4.25e14 tokens/sec"

Calculate and update rewards for address(0)\n 2. Get pending burn amount\n 3. Validate amount > 0\n 4. Burn tokens using rewardToken.burn()\n 5. Clear address(0) rewards\n 6. Emit RewardsBurned event\n @dev Note: The burn operation actually removes tokens from this contract\n      This is different from just clearing the rewards[address(0)] mapping\n Requirements:\n - Only owner can call\n - Pending rewards for address(0) must be > 0\n - Reward token must support burn() function\n Effects:\n - Tokens are burned (sent to dead address or permanently removed)\n - rewards[address(0)] = 0\n - Total reward token supply decreases\n Emits: RewardsBurned event with burn amount\n Example:\n - address(0) earned 100,000 tokens over 30 days\n - Owner calls burnUnstakedRewards()\n - 100,000 tokens are permanently burned\n - Total reward supply reduced by 100,000"
